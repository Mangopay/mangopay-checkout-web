# ‚úÖ Requirements

 - **Mangopay Sandbox Account**: Make sure you have a Mangopay sandbox account set up. This will provide you with a secure testing environment for integrating the Checkout functionality.

 - **Development Environment**: You'll need to have  Node.js and either Yarn or npm installed on your machine.

 - **Time Commitment**: The integration process is straightforward and should take approximately 10 minutes of your time.


## üîë Account creation and the API Key
You can get yourself a free sandbox account or sign up for a production account by registering on the Mangopay site (note that validation of your production account involves several steps, so think about doing it in advance of when you actually want to go live).

Login to your Mangopay Hub account, and grab your `clientId` and `API Key`, or create a new one. 

## üåê Configure and setup the backend
To facilitate end-to-end testing of your integration, we offer a pre-configured example back-end hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mangopay-example-checkout-backend). Follow these steps to set it up:

 - [Open the Glitch project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mangopay-example-checkout-backend?path=README.md).
 - Click the "Remix" button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the project.
 - In your newly remixed project, locate the `.env` file in the left sidebar and open it.
 - Set your Magopay credentials as specified in the project's README.md file.
 - With the credentials configured, your back-end implementation should now be up and running. You can monitor its activity by checking the logs in the bottom panel by clicking on the "Logs" button.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mangopay/mangopay-checkout-web.git`
